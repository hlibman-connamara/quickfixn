Connamara offers commercial support for developers who are integrating

or email, to the team that created QuickFIX/N and are maintainers of 
QuickFIX.

In addition to offering QuickFIX support, Connamara delivers Made-To-Measure 
Trading Solutions by bridging the gap between buy and build. By using 
internally developed trading platform components, Connamara delivers the 
best of off-the-shelf ISV solutions and custom application development. 
Coupled Connamara's unique licensing model, trading firms can get the 
best of both build and buy.
