Comparisons to QuickFIX
-----------------------
QuickFIX/N is a .NET port of [QuickFIX][0], an open source C++ FIX engine.<br/>

We love QuickFIX.  We have been contributors nearly since its
conception and use it heavily in our products and consulting.

The goal of QuickFIX/N is to create an open source FIX engine that feels
native to C#.  The (C++) QuickFIX project maintains a C# wrapper 
which has been used successfully in .NET for many years, but it results
in code that is not idiomatic of .NET development.  QuickFIX.NET
attempts to keep the same robustness and conformance of QuickFIX
with a similar API while brining native performance and idiomatic 
usage to .NET.

For Java development, please visit the excellent [QuickFIX/J][1].

QuickFIX/N uses the QuickFIX name with the full backing and support of QuickFIX and its creator Oren Miller.
