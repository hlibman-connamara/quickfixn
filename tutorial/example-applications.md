Example Applications
====================

We've made three QuickFIX/N example applications:

1. The [Trade Client][1] is a command line client that will send orders
2. The [Executor][0] takes orders over a FIX session and executes them.
3. The [UI Demo][2] is a graphical Windows application that allows a
   user to click around to send FIX messages.

The Trade Client and Executor can be configured to send and execute
orders with each other.
